# Modeling the Happy Meal

Classes are defined in `happymeal/models` and imported into the `app.py` file

`app.py` contains the setup (instantiation) of the meal and the call to get the calories.

You can reconfigure the happy meal there to see the change in calculations

You can run `python run.py` or `python -m run` to see this in action
